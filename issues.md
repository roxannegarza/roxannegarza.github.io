### <i class="fa-regular fa-people-arrows issues-icon"></i> **Thriving Communities in the Era of Covid**

--- 

#### Protecting our workers, families and children.

Responding to the pandemic and the suffering it caused and exposed must be a top priority of the next District 4 Supervisor. Roxanne demonstrated leadership to develop partnerships with Contra Costa Health Services, community-based organizations, and coalitions to respond to the Covid emergency and that experience will inform how to move us forward. We must address inequities in healthcare, education, transportation, and employment opportunities so all communities thrive.

#### Non-police Response To Mental Health Crises

The county’s Miles Hall Crisis Response Initiative, a non-police response to mental health crises, is a step in the right direction. Much more work needs to be done to ensure countywide implementation and partnerships with our cities. The loss of life in Walnut Creek and other cities demonstrates the need for a trained mobile team as a primary form of response with support from law enforcement only in situations where the threat of escalating violence. Most calls for help during mental health crises can be deescalated by properly trained and experienced clinical and peer staff.

---

Our campaign has been awarded the 2022 Moms Demand Action - Gun Sense Candidate distinction because Roxanne is committed to advocating for gun violence prevention and making a commitment to govern with gun safety in mind, when elected. Roxanne will fight for policies that are proven to reduce gun violence, protect children, and make our communities safer. She will speak out for change and use her position to advocate other decision makers to do the same.

### <i class="fa-regular fa-chart-pie issues-icon"></i> **Fiscal Accountability and Transparency**

---

#### Listen to the People

Support a values-based County budgeting model that engages a diverse range of residents to share valuable experiences, innovative ideas, and expert recommendations. This transparent approach will lead to effective decision-making for funding solutions and County policies that address key priority issues facing our County, such as healthcare, housing, public safety, amongst others. Community engagement opportunities can include: community-sponsored “meet & greets” with the Supervisor and County staff; community forums, advisory boards, webinars, social media platforms, etc.that are multilingual and multigenerational for expanded community participation.


### <i class="fa-regular fa-solid fa-house issues-icon"></i> **Sustainable Jobs and Housing**

---

#### Building partnerships

Find innovative partnerships to develop a well-trained workforce and increase economic development opportunities that bring sustainable wages to working families. Partnerships with local schools, Diablo Valley College, labor, business and community leaders will ensure residents have the resources to find the right career path and a sustainable life in our district and county. This will provide employment opportunities for future generations with economic security to live in our district.

#### Responsible Development

As the City of Concord plans the reuse project at the Naval Weapons Station, the next County Supervisor must create dialogue to ensure that it is a world-class sustainable project that will foster a vibrant and diverse economy. Roxanne’s experience with Community Benefits Agreement negotiations will help guarantee protections for workers, housing that is affordable to more residents and sustainable policies to protect the environment.

#### Affordable Housing and Protecting the Unsheltered

The Measure X Community Advisory Board (Roxanne is a member) had extensive dialogue with housing experts and there are some promising practices to support, including a Local Housing Trust Fund that would help fund programs including: tenant assistance; assistance for unsheltered residents; acquisition, preservation and rehab of affordable housing; affordable housing for people with developmental disabilities; community land trust; and permanent supportive housing.

### <i class="fa-regular fa-bus issues-icon"></i> **Transportation**

---

#### Connecting Neighborhoods and Reducing our Carbon Footprint

Create connected communities where residents can safely and conveniently walk, bicycle, use public transportation or drive from home to work, school or to recreate. We must create communities that help reduce households’ transportation costs, connect workers to jobs, facilitate upward mobility and reduce our carbon footprint.

### <i class="fa-regular fa-tree issues-icon"></i> **Safeguarding the Environment**

---

#### Air Quality

Roxanne will watch closely the implementation of Rule 6.5 that requires Chevron and PBF refineries to install the best available technology to reduce deadly particulate pollution. The refineries are legally contesting the passage of this rule by the BAAQMD. It will be critical for CCC Board of Supervisor representatives on the Board support this Rule and others to reduce PM.25 emissions which will reduce premature mortality and increase the average life span.

#### Industrial Safety Ordinance

After the NuStar Fire Supervisors Gioia and Glover directed that all agencies that regulate above-ground tanks conduct a regulatory gap analysis. When this analysis is complete and shared with Matt Kaufmann, HazMat Director, and the HazMat Commission, Roxanne will support adjustments to the Industrial Safety Ordinance that will ensure the community’s health and safety. Given that she works in Richmond, not far from the fence line, and has experienced the increase in emergency flaring at the Chevron facility, she will follow-up on the rationale for the increased incidence and its impact on the community’s health. She is also closely watching the next steps in the Air Monitoring Plan that is being led by a community-led Steering Committee and the BAAQMD.

#### Water

Roxanne opposes the proposal for the twin tunnels to export more water from the Delta estuary. This proposal would disrupt the delta’s ecosystem. Roxanne supports the Sierra Club’s proposals for local water agencies to incorporate long-term water management plans that include recycling, conservation, better groundwater management, and groundwater desalination.
